## 1. Introduction
-----

:arrows_counterclockwise: Feedback should be considered one of the main ingredients for a healthy and fruitful scholar activity. Incorporating feedback into scholar activities improves the communication between professors and students, which can ultimately create a much more fun, interactive and better targeted learning environment. Teachers can visualize their feedback improvements and students can demand their requests without fearing consequences.
Our application offers both students and teachers the opportunity to improve their scholar experience based on anonymous feedback. 

## 2. Main functionalities
-----

:pushpin: Our application targets both professors and students that are divided into two different types of users, chosen in the main page. Both categories will log in using their institutional email address and a predefined password they can change in the future. New users can also create an account by using the Register menu.
 As a professor, you can create a new activity (choosing the activity’s name, the date and time, and generating an unique code for the activity that will be stored in the database). After the students log in, the professor will see their anonymous feedback. At the end of the activity, a screen will be created with the number of feedbacks, the categories and the number of students that took part of the activity. The professor can also see a history page with all the classes and the variety of the reactions that have been registered.
	As a student, you can log in and enter the activity code. This will redirect the student to the activity’s screen where he or she can give anonymous and real time reactions to the course.

## 3. Detailed description of all the functionalities 
-----

:radio_button: The app will use the following controls: The register app starts with a RadioBox control, 2 EditText elements and a Button that permits the user to Login into his account. As a student, the next menu interface hold a button and an EditText. The next Menu interface is where the student can give continuous feedback to the professor, by clicking on one of the 4 buttons of the app, represented by 4 emojis.

As a teacher, after logging in, you are prompted with a menu with 3 Buttons, that offer the user the possibility to Create a New Activity, Enter an Activity and see your Feedback Activity. The Create a New Activity menu interface holds a dropDown element, a DateTime picker and a EditText for inserting the time of the course. The professor can randomly generate a code for the app only after completing the 3 fields. You can then exit, and choose to Enter an activity, where the same Enter Activity Code menu prompts.

When entering the activity, as a teacher you start to see a table connected to a database that stores the emoji-feedback from students correlated with specific time stamps. This feedback can also be found in the History interface, and accessed at any time by professors.
